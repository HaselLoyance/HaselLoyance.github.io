All content in this archive is viewable on any device even if you do not have internet connection. 99% of flash animations are converted to mp4 videos for browser with no support of *.swf files. Basically, you can finally read amazing MSPA comics on your tablet/mobile devices, without missing out in an action of animations.<br><br>I should warn you, because of *.swf to *.mp4 convertion, animated content takes up a lot more space than before. For your convience animation archive was split up into several parts. </p><p class="bold">Features</p><p><font class="bold">ALL COMICS</font> This archive includes all the current existing comics from MSPA website. Comics content was left as it is on an original website without changes to panels/images/text.</p><p><font class="bold">REDESIGN</font> The color scheme and style of every page was left as in original story, but a great part of distracting banners, news, links and menus was removed. Now it looks simple and nothing distracts you from reading.</p><p><font class="bold">ANIMATIONS</font> All posible animations were converted to mp4, which means you can view them on any device without problems. This will not require you installing addons, as mp4 videos are supported in every browser (who cares about IE6?).</p><p class="bold">Screenshots</p><div class="gallery"> <a href="/0_MSPAor/pic1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/0_MSPAor/pic1.jpg"></a> <a href="/0_MSPAor/pic2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="/0_MSPAor/pic2.jpg"></a> </div><p class="bold">FAQ</p><p><font class="bold">1. Is it even legal?</font><br>This is a big question, but I'll keep the answer short. There are no restrictions on MSPA content distribution, because there is simply no license. The only thing that is related to some kind of policy/terms on the MSPA website is <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/privacypolicy.htm" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, but there is nothing to be said about sharing/distributing content. I'm not a thief, therefore I'm NOT putting this content as a thing of my own creation and I'm NOT charging any money for it AND on every page I have a link to the original page and original author. Of course I modified the content of the pages to get rid of the banners, so please, go to the <a href="https://www.welovefine.com/homestuck-69.html">official store</a> with Homestuck merch and buy something to support Andrew Hussie. So how I see it - Yes, it is barely legal.</p><p><font class="bold">2. What are the ALL COMICS?</font><br>Every single comic on MSPA: Jailbreak, Problem Sleuth, Bard Quest, Blood Spade (it's only one page, but still), Ryanquest (not mentioned anywhere, but it exists), Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and Homestuck (of course). Archive also contains all the extra pages, that were made for donators, all FAQs, and MSPA donation page.</p><p><font class="bold">3. What are you using to download pages?</font><br>For this task I wrote a parser. It requires some modifications for every comic, but it's basically the same concept throughout. To convert Homestuck animations to mp4 I used <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel" target="_blank">Swivel</a>. And convertion makes files larger, of course, so animations are split into four parts. More about it later.</p><p><font class="bold">4. You wrote something about 99% of animations. What are the 1%?</font><br>Those are not animations, but interactive games, which involve user's input. I'm not going to convert them to HTML5 canvas games, so to check them out you still will need to have Internet connection.</p><p><font class="bold">5. How are archives divided?</font><br>I have a single MSPA-Offline archive, which contains all the pages with all the graphics for all the comics. Animations are divided into several parts, because they take up more space. Quick overview:<br>Part-1: ACT 1 - ACT5ACT1 <br>Part-2: ACT5ACT2 - INTERMISSION2<br>Part-3: ACT6 - ACT6INTERMISSON5<br>Part-4: ACT6ACT6 - ACT7</p><p><font class="bold">6. Why Mediafire?</font><br>Mediafire was my choice as it does not have bandwidth limit, so you can download archives without limiting the amount of how much you can download.</p><p><font class="bold">7. Any torrents?</font><br>Oh yes! Single torrent file is in the download section, although I think that it would be faster to download archives from the Mediafire, because not that many people share the torrent.</p><p><font class="bold">8. Why are screenshots so bad?</font><br>First, it's really hard to make a screenshot of a whole screen and then paste into 750px image box. Second, I can't find any good examples of pages to make good screenshots. Two will do.</p><p><font class="bold">9. I found a mistoke on a page. What can I do?</font><br>That's great, because I'm sure there are plenty of mistakes. You can find how to contact me on the contact page.</p><div class="downloadLinks"> <p class="bold">Download</p><p> <div class="btn"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ddm2mtrdujopm/MSPA-Offline" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;">MSPA-Offline</a></div><div class="btn"><a href="https://www.mediafire.com/folder/kb6fzck8c9tmp/Homestuck-Animations" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;">Homestuck-Animations</a></div><div class="btn"><a href="https://thepiratebay.org/torrent/16249120" target="_blank" style="color:inherit;">MSPA-Offline-Torrent</a></div></p></div></div>
