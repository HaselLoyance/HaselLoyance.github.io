   <p>In the future, where people live on a huge space station, humanity was left with only one living plant. One day, a scientist (probably not the smartest) placed that plant into the laboratory equipment incinerator. The plant was chopped down into pieces, packed in bags and shot out into space. With the help of advanced technologies, scientists can restore the plant, so the rescue squad was sent. You are the one of the members of the rescuing squad and your goal is to Save The Plant!</p>
