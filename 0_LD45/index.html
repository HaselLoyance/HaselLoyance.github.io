   <p>
      What has no beginning and no end? One would say that's a doughnut, but to them I would reply "You do not understand the metaphysical structure of the universe".
      <br><br>
      To explain the universe, we cannot really start from somewhere, as there is no beginning. Actually, there is nothing at all. No space, no void, and no time. But that begs a lot of question "Can we really say that something exists or does not exist somewhere?" and "Where is that somewhere?". To that I would reply "Um, actually I do not like philosophy this much. Now please excuse me, I have some <b>objective</b> things to attend to".
      <br><br>
     Your goal is to create something from nothing. Maybe that something is everything, or maybe that something is a base for everything. Use the <b>logic</b> and <b>atomic facts</b> to shape that something.

   <p>
   <ul>
      <li>2 base elements, <i>they will shape everything</i></li>
      <li>The great assembler, <i>this thing will consume elements to create other elements. Technically, the assembler is <b>there</b>, but again, do not worry about the philosophy of this. It is very stupid</i></li>
      <li>31 craftable elements, <i>they are truly something you have never experienced or seen before. It is worth every penny to see <b>Singularity</b></i></li>
      <li>Complicated and abstract themes, <i>this says it all. Or does it? <s class="smallerFont">Hey, Vsauce. Mich-</s></i></li>
      <li>Replay value, <i>tons of it. You can play with your eyes closed, or maybe with your monitor upside down. Possibilities are endless, really</i></li>
      <li>Responsive and aesthetically pleasing game play, <i>there are no distractions in this game, and combined with smooth controls it is really brilliant</i></li>
      <li>Inspired by Doodle God, <i>shh-- do not tell this anyone</i></li>
   </ul>

     NOTE 1: HTML5 version of the game might have issues with audio levels and performance, as GameMaker:Studio's HTML5 export is pretty trash.
     <br><br>
     NOTE 2: It is actually confirmed that it is possible to beat this game on a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaselLoyance/HaselLoyance.github.io/master/0_LD45/phone.jpg" target="_blank">phone</a>, while playing in mobile browser, but you really should not attempt this as you will suffer. I warned you.
