   <p>
      It's All Falling Apart Like ... like what? Honestly, I have no idea, but I know that "<i>all</i>"an relate to anything. Your code quality as Ludum Dare progresses? Oh yeah, definitely. Same applies to your sanity? Yep, that's for sure. Your life? Yes, but hopefully not...<br><br>It's All Falling Apart Like ... is a game about controlling a thing with keys that can pick up good things and kill bad things oh and all the things also can jump and a lot more... This game... maybe it's a platformer, maybe it's a tower defense (or maybe it's a plane?), maybe it has battle royale elements to it or maybe I just believe that it does...<br><br>The platforms on each level are collapsing under the deepness of the subtle plot... You need to try your best to survive.<br><br>Do you see how many ellipses I'm using? Am I doing this for a joke? I don't know. You'll have to find out for yourself... Yeah... This is truly something... Really makes you think... ü§î

   <p>
   <ul>
      <li>Underground setting, <i>why? Well imagine this is like a mineshaft, so the falling wooden platforms actually make sense now. Simple‚Ñ¢</i></li>
      <li>3 unique levels, <i>the ones you've never seen before. Because you've never seen this game. I recommend, 9/10, but needs more procedural generation</i></li>
      <li>Replay value, <i>tons of it. You can play with your eyes closed, or maybe with your monitor upside down. Possibilities are endless, really</i></li>
      <li>3 powerups, <i>those are things that do good things for you. These can be the key to survival, no joke, especially when used by a real player and not by an enemy</i></li>
      <li>Smart enemies, <i>those are things that do no good things for you. <b>HEY, LOOK, THEY ARE SMART, ALRIGHT??? THEY ARE TRYING THEIR BEST TO COMPETE WITH YOU. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT THAT YOU HAVE A BRAIN AND THEY HAVE ONLY 650 LINES OF SPAGHETTI CODE WRITTEN BY A DRUNK CODER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU DIE YOU GET TO ENJOY ENEMIES PLAYING ALL BY THEMSELVES. HA. HAHA. THEY ARE FULLY INDEPENDENT AND DON'T NEED YOU</b></i> üí™üò§</li>
      <li>Realistic combat, <i>this is basically your typical battle royale game, but it can be played on a potato calculator without Internet connection. Seriously, you aren't eager to play it yet?</i></li>
