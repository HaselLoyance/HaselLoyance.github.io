   <p> Lately I've noticed that some people truly appreciate my work, and with their kind hearts they want to help me out just a little bit. Just like me, they understand that student loans are not going to pay themselves. If you find my work interesting, then please feel free to sponsor my <a href="https://buymeacoff.ee/rwly8PutT" target="_blank">coffee addiction</a> that is currently covered entirely by my ever-growing student loans.
