   <p> This is a full offline copy of <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?viewpage=archive" class="linkColor" target="_blank">Microsoft Paint Adventures (MSPA)</a> website. All content in this archive is viewable on any device even if you do not have internet connection. 99% of flash animations are converted to mp4 videos for browser with no support of *.swf files. Basically, you can finally read amazing MSPA comics on your tablet/mobile devices, without missing out in an action of animations.<br><br>
   I should warn you, because of *.swf to *.mp4 conversion, animated content takes up a lot more space than before. For your convience animation archive was split up into several parts.

       <font class="header important" >FAQ</font><br>
       <div  style="text-align:left;">
       <font class="important">1. Is it even legal?</font>
       <p>This is a big question, but I'll keep the answer short. There are no restritions on MSPA content distribution, because there is simply no license. The only thing that is related to some kind of policy/terms on the MSPA website is <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/privacypolicy.htm" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>, but there is nothing to be said about sharing/distributing content. I'm not a thief, therefore I'm NOT putting this content as a thing of my own creation and I'm NOT charging any money for it. On every page I have a link to the original page and original author. Of course I modified the content of the pages to get rid of the banners, so please, go to the <a href="www.welovefine.com/homestuck-69.html">official shop</a> with Homestuck merch and buy something to support the author. So how I see it - Yes, it barely legal.</p>
       <font class="important">2. What are the ALL COMICS?</font>
       <p>Every single comic on MSPA: Jailbreak, Problem Sleuth, Bard Quest, Blood Spade (it's only one page, but still), Ryanquest (not mentioned anywhere, but it exists), Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff and ONLY A HALF (yet) of Homestuck. Archive also contains all the extra pages, that were made for donators, all FAQs, and MSPA donation page.</p>
       <font class="important">3. Only half of Homestuck?</font>
       <p>Sadly, yes. This half is everything from beginning of Act 1 to the end of Intermission 2. The main reason for that, is because I did not finish reading Homestuck, and some parts of the downloading process include spoilers, and I don't want to ruin the fun. It will be updated with all the pages once I finish it.</p>
       <font class="important">4. What are the spoilers in the downloading process? You download pages by hand?</font>
       <p>For page downloads I wrote a parser, so there is no problem with that. It just runs and outputs logs to the console. Not to much to spoil there. The problem are animations. To convert them to mp4 I use <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/wiki/creator-resources/flash-resources/swivel" target="_blank">Swivel</a> and conversion progress involves me in watching the cutscenes.</p>
       <font class="important">5. You wrote something about 99% of animations. What are the 1%?</font>
       <p>Those are not animations, but interactive games, which involve user input. I'm not going to convert them to HTML5 canvas games, so to check them out you still will need Internet Connection.</p>
       <font class="important">6. How do I install/unpack the archives?</font>
       <p>That's a good question, because I used ZSTD algorithm to pack everything (gotta save those 5MB from animation archives). In download links you can find README files for every archive. They contain all the instructions as well as hash information. TLDR: you'll need to have 7-Zip archiver with ZSTD support.</p>
       <font class="important">7. How are archives devided?</font>
       <p>I have a signle MSPA-Offline archive, which contains all the pages with all the graphics for all the comics. The only exception is Homestuck. There are only 4110 pages. Once it is fully done, I will replace this archive, so it contains everything. I also will make a "patch" to download only missing Homestuck pages.<br>Other archives are animations. They are devided into several parts, because they take up more space. Once Homestuck is finished - there will be more archives with animations. (4?) </p>
       <font class="important">8. Why Mediafire and not torrent?</font>
       <p>Mediafire was my choice as it does not have bandwidth limit, so you can download archives without limiting the amount of how much you can download. Torrent file (only one for everything) will be available once everything is finished (other Homestuck pages).</p>
       <font class="important">9. Why are screenshots so bad?</font>
       <p>First, it's really hard to make a screenshot of a whole screen and then paste into 750px image box. Second, I can't find any good examples of pages to make good screenshots. Two will do.</a></p>
       <font class="important">10. I found a mistake on a page. What can I do?</font>
       <p>You can find how to contact me on the contact page (really?).</a></p>
