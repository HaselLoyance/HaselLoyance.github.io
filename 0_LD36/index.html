   <p>First door was made more than 5000 years ago. <br>Doors block off, and allow access within an enclosed space. <br>But for ancient people doors also had mythical meaning. <br><br>Someone thought their LAST door would lead to the new life. <br><br>The others' guess was the endless void. </p>

This is not a joke) </p>
