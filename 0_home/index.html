This place is like an entire junkyard (and also graveyard) of all the things I finished, or started to work on and never finished.</p><p>A neat menu will be your guide here. Check out my projects, but please, oh please please please, use your brains when downloading and/or using software/whatever, because some of it might go against licenses of other oranizations (more details on project's page).</p><p>And one more thing: I'm definitely not that lame to put random easter eggs all over the place. <a class="smallerFont ignoreLink" href="https://youtu.be/lXMskKTw3Bc?t=27" target="_blank">Not at all</a>.</p></div>
