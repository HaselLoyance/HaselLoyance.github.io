On my free time I enjoy doing lots of random open-source things. And by <i>random</i> I really do mean <i>random</i>. From a <a href="#MidiBeeper" onclick="GetPageContents(this);">console program that beeps out MIDI files</a> to a <a href="#IWRTU" onclick="GetPageContents(this);">polished Unity game</a>. From <a href="#WPE" onclick="GetPageContents(this);">wallpapers for Wallpaper Engine</a> to an <a href="#MSPAor" onclick="GetPageContents(this);">offline version of the entire Homestuck</a>. You get the idea, they are truly random. These projects are a great way to spend my time with enjoyment and to develop my skills in lots of different areas.</p><p>This website serves purely only one purpose: to assemble together everything I've ever done (not only coding related) and deliver it in a slightly nicer way than just a list of repositories on Github. This place is like an entire junkyard (and also a graveyard) of all the things I finished, or started to work on and never finished. Half-professional portfolio, so-to-speak.</p><p>A neat menu will be your guide here. Feel free to check out my projects, my social media, maybe even consider donating to help me deal with my student loans.</p><p>And one more thing: I'm definitely not that lame to put stupid easter eggs all over the place. <a class="smallerFont ignoreLink" href="https://youtu.be/lXMskKTw3Bc?t=27" target="_blank">Not at all</a>.</p></div>
