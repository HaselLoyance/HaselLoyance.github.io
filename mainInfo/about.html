 <h2 class="header">About YOL Productions</h2> 
 <hr>
 <p>YOL Productions is an independent application making company. It was originally created by only one person, who names himself Yolk. This is from Russian word Yolka (Йолка), which can simply be translated as Xmas Tree. 
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>Our company mainly specifies on bringing the highest possible and very simple usability to the user. Most of our programs are console-based and are written using Microsoft Visual Studio C++. Although applications are console based, they are still very powerful. We also specialize on making games, game engines and libraries full of useful features.
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>Some of our products will not be ever open-sourced, so for that reason, to ensure safety we always put results of Virustotal scan on product's page.
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>We suggest you to check out <font class="header"><a href="" onclick="loadContent('terms',3, true)">Terms</a></font> tab, so there are no misunderstandings between YOL Productions policies and you.
