 <hr>
 <p>First thing to address, this is not a real company. It's kinda unofficial name for all the stuff I make. Just because it sounds cool and official by itself. Everything that is published on this website is made by me. Some content does not belong to me, or even violates the licensing of other sources, so that's that. <br><br>

 There is not much to say besides that. Just be smart about the stuff published here, and respect the content that does not belong to me, because I just share it with you. As long as you won't cause any harm, I won't take it down or whatever. A lot of things I do here is just for my own education purposes (yeah, right). To be honest, I'm pretty sure nobody will find this EVER, so I don't really care.<br><br>
 You can think of this website as a personal webpage. Menu is self-explanatory, so you shouldn't have trouble locating products, contacts or terms of use. glhf.
